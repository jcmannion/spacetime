                    while joyriding in a stolen spaceship you flew too close to a blackhole and got 
                    flung across the universe, many galaxies away from home.<br/>  
                    Your ship's navigation is broke and there is no telling where the spacetime has 
                    put you.  You are flying blindly and cannot find a direct route back to earth so 
                    you have to find another blackhole and hope that it will bring you home.<br/>  
                    Unfortunately, while traveling through the spacetime many systems for your 
                    ship have been damaged.  Your hull defense and weapons systems are the main 
                    areas to worry about. However, don't worry your ship has an automatic repair 
                    system, but it will take time to repair all the damage.<br/>  
                    This far from home you will be in constant danger so you will always have to 
                    be on the move and on the look out for another blackhole.<br/> 
                    While you are waiting 
                    you will have to avoid any floating asteroids.  One hit and your hull will be 
                    breached and the ship will be lost.<br/>  
                    Regrettably, without any weapons all you 
                    can do is fly around the obstacles.<br/>  
                    Always be on the alert and good luck getting home!</p>

                    Good job on avoiding being hit by the floating asteroids and finding another blackhole.  
                    However, you still aren't close to home and the ship's navigation is still broke so 
                    there is no telling where you are or where you are suppose to go.<br/>
                    Good news though!<br/>
                    The ship's automatic repair system has been at work.  All systems are still not 
                    fully functional, but the defense and weapon's systems are now online.  There are 
                    still some glitches and the ship will only be able to take one strike, two and you 
                    will have to abandon ship and be stuck far from home.<br/>
                    Also, you have some functionality with your weapons and it should be able to fire 
                    at the asteroids and blow up the ones you cannot avoid.  However, the cooling system 
                    is still not repaired and after only 20 or so shots the weapons system will begin 
                    to overheat and the system will go back offline.<br/>
                    Find another blackhole and again good luck!</p>

                    You found another blackhole!!!<br/>
                    Unfortunately, you are still lost.<br/>
                    And, you were cast extremely close to a planet.  The planets gravity is tremendously strong and it
                    is making the asteroids travel faster.  Be alert as you travel through the asteroids and continue
                    to journey home.<br/>
                    The good news is that the ship's defense system is back fully operational.  However, don't get too
                    comfortable because your hull can only take 4 strikes before it is compromised.  So continue to
                    avoid the asteroids whenever possible.<br/>
                    Your weapons system is taking setbacks every time you travel through a blackhole.  It has improved 
                    though, your weapons cooling is now working better and you can fire 30 or so times before it overheats
                    and goes offline.<br/>
                    Continue on your mission to find a spacetime home.<br/>
                    Good Luck!!!</p>

<!-- Fourth Board Scroll -->

                    You made it to another blackhole and away from that planet's gravitational field and not a moment 
                    too soon, the gravity was beginning to pull you down.  A crash on the planet's surface would have 
                    likely destroyed your ship and any chance at getting home.<br/>
                    Some really good news to report though is that the navigational system is starting to come online.
                    The initial reading indicates that you are only a couple galaxies away from home.  But until the
                    system comes online fully you can't navigate directly home and have to be on the look out for 
                    another blackhole.<br/>
                    Also, your weapons system is fully operational and not a moment too soon because where you have
                    found yourself now has more asteroids than you have encountered before.  Use your combat skills
                    and destroy any asteroids that get in your way.<br/>
                    And don't forget to be on the look out for the next blackhole.  It may be your ticket home.<br/>
                    Again Good luck.</p>

                    This last trip through a spacetime has given your ship the time to fix all the systems that were
                    damaged.<br/>
                    Your ship is fully operational and the navigation system has plotted a course home.  It has found
                    the blackhole you need to be transported back to your planet.<br/>
                    And best of all is that the scanners don't detect any asteroids in this galaxy.<br/>
                    That was the good news. . .<br/>
                    Regrettably, you were again taken to the proximity of a planet.  This one is inhabited though
                    by an advanced race of people who view you as a threat.<br/>
                    They have sent a space destroyer to capture you or exterminate you if necessary.<br/>
                    Even if you don't want war it is being brought to you.  The only way to the blackhole you need in
                    order to travel home is blocked by this destroyer.<br/>
                    You have to destroy the threat and go through to make it home.  Fire at the destroyer until it explodes.
                    Its defenses are more advanced than yours and the ship will respond to being fired at.  It will travel 
                    faster so be quick and diligent.<br/>
                    You are almost home.  Good luck, you will need it!!!</p>
